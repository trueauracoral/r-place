# r-place

My attempt at recreating r/place.

It uses JavaScript and it doesn't work. ALl you can do is place pixels. Instead of using JavaScript's canvas feature it uses tables and onclick events to change `background-color`.

It's live on github pages: https://trueauracoral.github.io/r-place/

## Future...
- Use Canvas API
- Rewrite in flask
- Use input radio
- **Become CSS god**

### Inspiration
Please check out davidovski and his version with NO JS and it actually works. https://davidovski.xyz/cellgrid/
